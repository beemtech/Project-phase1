# Aviation Risk Analysis Project ✈️

## Project Overview
This project analyzes aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) between 1962 and 2023.  
Our goal is to help a business stakeholder identify the safest aircraft makes and models for expanding into commercial and private aviation.

2. Load data with appropriate encoding.
3. Select relevant columns to create a working subset.
4. Handle missing values and clean the dataset.
5. Analyze:
   - Safest aircraft makes and models.
   - Best aircraft types to start with.
   - Key operational risks (weather, flight phase).
6. Visualize results using bar charts with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
7. Build an interactive dashboard using Tableau.
